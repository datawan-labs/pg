# Rego Data Filtering Playground

This is based on the wonderfully hackable
[PostgreSQL Playground](https://github.com/datawan-labs/pg).

It's been adapted to demonstrate the data filtering capabilities
we're working on in the Enterprise OPA Platform.


## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. `docker compose up`
3. Go to http://localhost:3000
